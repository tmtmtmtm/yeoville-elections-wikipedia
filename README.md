The code and queries etc here are unlikely to be updated as my process
evolves. Later repos will likely have progressively different approaches
and more elaborate tooling, as my habit is to try to improve at least
one part of the process each time around.

---------

Step 1: Configure config.json
=============================

All the relevant metadata now lives in config.json: ideally nothing will
need tweaked after this. We need to be careful here to get the history
of Wikidata IDs for the constituency correct.

Step 1: Scrape the results
==========================

```sh
bundle exec ruby scraper.rb config.json | tee wikipedia.csv
```

Step 2: Check for missing party IDs
===================================

```sh
xsv search -v -s party 'Q' wikipedia.csv
```

One Independent to link in Wikipedia; one Democratic Conservative that's
probably just a flavour of Independent, so skipping for now; one
"Constitution and Reform" that already exists in Wikidata; one to
create:

* wb ce create-new-party.js "Anti-Paddy Ashdown Keep Britain Independent"

Ste 3: Check for missing election IDs
=====================================

```sh
xsv search -v -s election 'Q' wikipedia.csv | xsv select electionLabel | uniq
```

Nothing missing.

Step 4: Generate possible missing person IDs
============================================

```sh
xsv search -v -s id 'Q' wikipedia.csv | xsv select name | tail +2 |
  sed -e 's/^/"/' -e 's/$/"@en/' | paste -s - |
  xargs -0 wd sparql find-candidates.js |
  jq -r '.[] | [.name, .item.value, .election.label, .constituency.label, .party.label] | @csv' |
  tee candidates.csv
```

Step 5: Combine Those
=====================

```sh
xsv join -n --left 2 wikipedia.csv 1 candidates.csv | xsv select '10,1-8' | sed $'1i\\\nfoundid' | tee combo.csv
```

Step 6: Generate QuickStatements commands
=========================================

```sh
bundle exec ruby generate-qs.rb config.json | tee commands.qs
```
